# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level roadmap for the Vermeil project. The project is divided into several phases, each focusing on a specific set of goals.

## Phase 1: Foundational Models (Text and Image)

*   **Goal:** Develop and train baseline models for text and image modalities.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Set up the complete project structure and development environment.
    *   Collect and preprocess large-scale datasets for text and images.
    *   Train a foundational text-based model (e.g., a Transformer-based language model).
    *   Train a foundational image generation model (e.g., a GAN or a diffusion model).
    *   Establish a comprehensive evaluation framework with standard metrics for both models.

## Phase 2: Multimodal Integration

*   **Goal:** Integrate the text and image models into a single multimodal architecture.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Research and implement state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques.
    *   Develop and implement a novel multimodal architecture that effectively combines the text and image backbones.
    *   Train the integrated multimodal model on a diverse set of multimodal tasks.
    *   Evaluate the model on benchmarks for tasks like image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and text-to-image generation.

## Phase 3: Scaling and Optimization

*   **Goal:** Scale the models and optimize them for performance.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Scale up the model size and training datasets.
    *   Implement and optimize distributed training across multiple GPUs and nodes.
    *   Apply model optimization techniques such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation.
    *   Fine-tune the models for specific downstream tasks.

## Phase 4: Advanced Capabilities and Deployment

*   **Goal:** Extend the model's capabilities and deploy it for real-world use.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Incorporate additional modalities such as audio and video.
    *   Explore and integrate advanced AI capabilities like reasoning, planning, and tool use.
    *   Develop a robust and scalable API for serving the model.
    *   Create a public-facing demo using Gradio to showcase the model's capabilities.
    *   Release the first official version of the Vermeil model and publish the accompanying research paper.
