## Project Overview

Vermeil is designed to be a powerful and versatile model capable of understanding and generating content across multiple modalities, including text, images, and audio. Our goal is to push the boundaries of multimodal research and make advanced AI accessible to everyone.

This repository provides the complete framework for:
- **Data Processing**: Tools for downloading, preprocessing, and loading various datasets.
- **Model Training**: Source code for training unimodal and multimodal models with support for distributed training.
- **Evaluation**: Scripts for evaluating model performance on a wide range of benchmarks.
- **Inference**: APIs and interfaces for running inference with trained models.
- **Deployment**: Docker files and configurations for deploying the model in production environments.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Conda**: This project uses Conda for environment management. Make sure you have Miniconda or Anaconda installed.
- **Git LFS**: This project uses Git LFS for handling large files. Follow the instructions [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to install it.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/VermeilTheUltimateModel.git
    cd VermeilTheUltimateModel/vermeil-the-ultimate-model
    ```

2.  **Set up Git LFS:**
    ```bash
    git lfs install
    ```

3.  **Create and activate the Conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate vermeil
    ```

4.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

This section provides a brief overview of how to train and use the models.

### Training

To train a model, you can use the training scripts located in the `src/training/` directory. First, configure your training run by modifying the YAML files in the `configs/training/` directory.

**Example:** To train a text model, you can run:
```bash
python src/training/trainer_base.py --config configs/training/text_config.yaml
```

For more advanced training setups, such as distributed training, refer to the tools in the `tools/distributed/` directory.

### Inference

Once a model is trained, you can use the inference scripts in `src/inference/` to generate outputs.

**Example:** To run inference with a text model:
```bash
python src/inference/text_infer.py --checkpoint_path models/checkpoints/text/best_model.pt --prompt "Hello, world!"
```

You can also use the FastAPI server for a more interactive experience. See the `deployment/fastapi_app/` directory for more details.
