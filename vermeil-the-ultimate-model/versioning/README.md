# Versioning

This directory contains documents related to the versioning of the Vermeil project. Clear and consistent versioning is essential for tracking the progress of the project, communicating changes to users, and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

## Versioning Scheme

We use [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) for the Vermeil project. The version number is in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

-   **MAJOR** version is incremented when you make incompatible API changes.
-   **MINOR** version is incremented when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
-   **PATCH** version is incremented when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

## Release Notes

For each new release, we create a new markdown file in this directory that contains the release notes for that version. The release notes should include:

-   A summary of the changes in the release.
-   A list of new features.
-   A list of bug fixes.
-   Any breaking changes.
-   A list of contributors to the release.

The release notes should be written in a clear and concise manner and should be targeted at both users and developers.

## Changelog

In addition to the release notes, we also maintain a `changelog.md` file in the `governance/` directory. The changelog is a more detailed record of all the changes made to the project, while the release notes are a more high-level summary of the most important changes.

## Why is Versioning Important?

-   **It provides a clear way to track the history of the project**: By looking at the version numbers and the release notes, you can quickly see how the project has evolved over time.
-   **It helps users understand what to expect**: When you release a new version of the model, the version number tells users whether they can expect breaking changes or just new features and bug fixes.
-   **It facilitates collaboration**: When everyone is using the same versioning scheme, it is easier to collaborate on the project and to ensure that everyone is working with the same version of the code.

By following a consistent versioning scheme and by writing clear and informative release notes, we can make the Vermeil project more professional, more user-friendly, and more sustainable in the long run.
