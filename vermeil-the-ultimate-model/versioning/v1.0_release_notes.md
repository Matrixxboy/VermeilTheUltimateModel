# Vermeil v1.0 Release Notes

We are thrilled to announce the first official release of Vermeil, a powerful, open-source multimodal AI model. This release marks a major milestone in our journey to build a state-of-the-art model from scratch and make it accessible to everyone.

## New Features

-   **Multimodal Architecture**: Vermeil v1.0 features a novel multimodal architecture that can process and understand both text and images in a unified representation space.
-   **Text-to-Image Generation**: The model can generate high-quality images from textual descriptions.
-   **Image Captioning**: The model can generate descriptive captions for a given image.
-   **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: The model can answer questions about the content of an image.
-   **Pre-trained Models**: We are releasing a set of pre-trained models that have been trained on a large-scale dataset of text and images.
-   **FastAPI Integration**: The release includes a FastAPI application for easy deployment and interaction with the model.
-   **Gradio Demo**: We have created a Gradio demo to showcase the model's capabilities in an interactive way.

## Model Performance

We have evaluated Vermeil v1.0 on a wide range of benchmarks for text-to-image generation, image captioning, and VQA. The model achieves competitive performance with other state-of-the-art models.

| Task                      | Benchmark      | Metric     | Score |
| :------------------------ | :------------- | :--------- | :---- |
| **Text-to-Image**         | MS-COCO        | CLIP Score | TBD   |
| **Image Captioning**      | MS-COCO        | CIDEr      | TBD   |
| **Visual Question Answering** | VQA v2         | VQA Score  | TBD   |

*Note: The final scores will be updated upon completion of the evaluation.* 

## Known Issues

-   The model may sometimes generate images with artifacts or inconsistencies.
-   The model's understanding of complex spatial relationships in images is still limited.
-   The VQA module may struggle with questions that require external knowledge or common-sense reasoning.

We are actively working on addressing these limitations in future releases.
