# Dataset Licenses

This document provides an overview of common licenses used for datasets and their implications for the Vermeil project. It is crucial to understand and comply with these licenses to ensure that our work is both ethical and legal.

## Creative Commons (CC) Licenses

Creative Commons licenses are a set of standardized licenses that allow creators to grant permissions for others to use their work. They are widely used for datasets and other creative content.

-   **[CC0 (Public Domain Dedication)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**: This is the most permissive license. The creator has dedicated the work to the public domain, waiving all of their rights to the work worldwide under copyright law. You can copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, without asking permission.

-   **[CC BY (Attribution)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**: This license allows you to copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original creator.

-   **[CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)**: This license is similar to CC BY, but it also requires that any derivative works you create be licensed under the same CC BY-SA license. This is a "copyleft" license.

-   **[CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)**: This license allows you to copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work for non-commercial purposes only. You must also give appropriate credit to the original creator.

-   **[CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)**: This license combines the restrictions of CC BY-NC and CC BY-SA. You can copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work for non-commercial purposes only, and any derivative works must be licensed under the same CC BY-NC-SA license.

## Open Data Commons Licenses

Open Data Commons provides a set of legal tools for open data.

-   **[Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/)**: Similar to CC0, this license allows you to freely share, modify, and use the data for any purpose without any restrictions.

-   **[Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-By)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/)**: This license requires you to attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the license.

-   **[Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/)**: This is a "Share-Alike" license for databases. It allows you to freely share, modify, and use the database, but you must also share any derivative databases under the same ODbL license.

## Software Licenses for Code in Datasets

Sometimes, datasets are distributed with code (e.g., for parsing or evaluation). This code may be licensed under a software license.

-   **[MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)**: A permissive license that allows you to do almost anything with the code, including using it in proprietary software, as long as you include the original copyright and license notice.

-   **[Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)**: Another permissive license that also includes an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.

-   **[GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)**: A strong "copyleft" license. If you use GPL-licensed code in your project, your project must also be licensed under the GPL.

## Our Policy

For the Vermeil project, we will adhere to the following policy regarding dataset licenses:

1.  **Prioritize Permissive Licenses**: We will prioritize the use of datasets with permissive licenses (e.g., CC0, CC BY, PDDL, ODC-By, MIT, Apache 2.0) to maximize the flexibility and impact of our work.

2.  **Comply with Attribution Requirements**: We will meticulously track the licenses of all datasets we use and ensure that we comply with any attribution requirements.

3.  **Handle "Share-Alike" Licenses with Care**: We will be cautious when using datasets with "Share-Alike" licenses (e.g., CC BY-SA, ODbL) and ensure that we are prepared to release our derivative works under the same license.

4.  **Avoid "Non-Commercial" Licenses for Core Model**: For the core Vermeil model, we will avoid using datasets with "Non-Commercial" licenses (e.g., CC BY-NC) to ensure that the model can be used for a wide range of applications.

5.  **Isolate GPL-Licensed Code**: We will be extremely careful when using any code licensed under the GPL to avoid any legal complications with our own codebase.

By being mindful of dataset licenses, we can build the Vermeil model on a solid legal and ethical foundation.
