# Experiments

This directory is for tracking experiments conducted during the development of the Vermeil model. Each subdirectory in this directory represents a single experiment and should contain all the files necessary to reproduce that experiment.

## Why Track Experiments?

Tracking experiments is crucial for a research project like Vermeil. It allows you to:

-   **Keep a record of what you have tried**: This prevents you from repeating experiments and helps you build on your previous work.
-   **Reproduce your results**: A well-documented experiment can be easily reproduced by yourself or by others.
-   **Compare different approaches**: By comparing the results of different experiments, you can identify which approaches are most promising.
-   **Collaborate with others**: A shared record of experiments makes it easier to collaborate with other researchers.

## Experiment Directory Structure

Each experiment should have its own subdirectory, named in a way that clearly identifies the experiment (e.g., `exp_001_text_baseline`, `exp_002_image_gan_with_new_loss`). Inside each experiment directory, you should include:

-   **`config.yaml`**: The configuration file used for the experiment. This should be a copy of the configuration file from the `configs/` directory that was used to run the experiment.
-   **`report.md`**: A markdown file that describes the experiment. This should include the hypothesis, the methodology, the results, and a conclusion.
-   **`results.json`**: A JSON file that contains the key results of the experiment, such as the final evaluation metrics.
-   **`logs/`**: A subdirectory that contains the training logs from the experiment. This can include the output of the training script, as well as any logs from TensorBoard or other monitoring tools.
-   **Other artifacts**: Any other artifacts generated by the experiment, such as model checkpoints, sample outputs, or visualizations.

## Best Practices

-   **Be consistent**: Use a consistent naming convention for your experiment directories and the files within them.
-   **Be thorough**: Document your experiments in as much detail as possible. The more information you include, the easier it will be to reproduce your results.
-   **Use a template**: You can create a template for your `report.md` file to ensure that you include all the necessary information.
-   **Version your experiments**: If you make changes to an experiment, you can create a new version of the experiment directory (e.g., `exp_001_text_baseline_v2`).

By following these best practices, you can create a valuable record of your research that will be a great asset to the Vermeil project.
