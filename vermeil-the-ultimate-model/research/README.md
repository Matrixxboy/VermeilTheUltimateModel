# Research

This directory is for storing research-related documents and notes. It serves as a knowledge base for the Vermeil project, capturing the ideas, insights, and discoveries made during the research and development process.

## Directory Structure

-   **`experiments_notes/`**: This subdirectory contains notes on the various experiments conducted during the project. This can include informal observations, preliminary results, and ideas for future experiments.

-   **`future_scope/`**: This subdirectory contains documents that outline the long-term vision for the project. This is where we can dream big and explore ideas that are beyond the current roadmap.

-   **`literature_reviews/`**: This subdirectory contains reviews of relevant academic papers and articles. Keeping up with the latest research is crucial for a project like Vermeil, and this directory serves as a place to organize and summarize our findings.

-   **`theoretical/`**: This subdirectory is for exploring the theoretical aspects of the models and algorithms used in the project. This can include things like mathematical derivations, proofs, and studies of the models' properties.

## The Importance of a Research Directory

A dedicated research directory is important for several reasons:

-   **It encourages a research-oriented mindset**: By having a place to store research notes and ideas, we encourage a more systematic and thoughtful approach to development.
-   **It facilitates knowledge sharing**: A shared research directory makes it easier for team members to learn from each other and to build on each other's work.
-   **It preserves institutional knowledge**: As the project grows and team members come and go, the research directory serves as a valuable repository of institutional knowledge.

## How to Contribute

Everyone on the team is encouraged to contribute to the research directory. If you have an idea, an insight, or a summary of a paper you have read, please add it to the appropriate subdirectory.

When adding a new document, please try to be as clear and concise as possible. Use markdown to format your document and make it easy to read.

By actively contributing to the research directory, we can create a valuable resource that will help us push the boundaries of AI research.
